DURATION:1 MONTH
DESCRIPTION:

 This project is a dynamic Product Listing Grid built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for products in real time, filter them by category (such as Electronics, Fashion, or Books), and sort them by price (Low to High or High to Low). The layout is responsive using CSS Grid, and all interactivity is handled with clean, modular JavaScriptâ€”making it a great foundation for any e-commerce frontend or product showcase interface.
